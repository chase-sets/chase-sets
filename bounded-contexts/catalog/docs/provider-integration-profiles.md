# Provider Integration Profiles

Catalog provider integrations own the Catalog structure required to ingest and promote provider facts.

## Purpose

A provider integration profile is Catalog-owned setup for a product line or provider. It can create or reconcile Fields, Dimensions, Options, Components, Blueprints, Categories, Reference Types, and Reference Records needed by the integration.

Provider integration profiles are not fake data. They are the authoring structure that lets operators import, review, promote, and publish real provider observations.

## TCGdex Pokemon TCG Profile

The TCGdex Pokemon TCG profile installs the Pokemon card and sealed-product structure used by TCGdex Source Observations:

- card identity Fields such as Card Number, Card Name, Expansion, Rarity, Card Illustrator, and Release Year
- product-resolution Dimensions such as Form, Condition, Grading Company, and Grade
- Pokemon TCG Components and Blueprints
- Pokemon TCG Categories
- Reference Types and Reference Records for Manufacturer, Product Line, Series, and Expansion

Expansion Reference Records may carry `printed-card-count` when the number printed on cards differs from the provider's official count or when promo-style numbering should omit a denominator.

TCGdex imports still write Source Observations. Promotion remains a Catalog review action. Staging and production do not auto-import provider content during bootstrap.

## Future Integrations

Future TCG integrations should add their own provider integration profile when their structure differs from Pokemon TCG. Do not place integration-specific fields or blueprints in deployables, and do not make scenario data the source of structural truth.

Each profile should define:

- provider key and supported lookup/import scopes
- required Fields and value types
- reusable Reference Types and Reference Records
- Dimensions and Options that affect product identity
- Components and Blueprints used to author and resolve Products
- Categories used for browse grouping
- promotion mapping from normalized provider observations into Catalog Item commands

## Boundary

Catalog owns provider integration profiles. Discovery, Inventory, Marketplace, Checkout, Ordering, Pricing, and other downstream contexts consume promoted Catalog facts and resolved Product structure; they do not own provider structure.
