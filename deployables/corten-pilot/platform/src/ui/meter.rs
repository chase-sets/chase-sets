// corten ui 0.1.0: meter 29bce52bd5f2cf19
//! A measure in a known range (quota used, storage, a budget), as the classes of the `<meter>` you
//! write, so a screen reader reads it as a value, not loose text:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! <Field id={LimitId} label="Sold this month" hint="It resets on the 1st." error="">
//!     <meter
//!         class={Meter {}}
//!         id={LimitId}
//!         aria-describedby={HintId(&LimitId)}
//!         aria-valuetext={t.money(Minor(sold), USD)}
//!         min="0"
//!         max={LIMIT}
//!         low={LIMIT / 3 * 2}
//!         high={LIMIT / 10 * 9}
//!         optimum="0"
//!         value={sold}
//!     >
//!         {t.money(Minor(sold), USD)}
//!     </meter>
//! </Field>
//! ```
//!
//! A screen reader reads the value as a number; `aria-valuetext` gives it as text the app formats
//! (an amount, not "12375").
//!
//! With no `low` or `high` it is a plain measure, in the primary color. With them, its color is the
//! state the browser works out from `low`, `high` and `optimum`: the success color in the good
//! range, the warning color one range off it, the destructive color two off. Under forced colors
//! (a contrast theme) every state is drawn in the system's highlight color, so a state that matters
//! is also said in words beside the meter (the field's hint). Progress through a task is a
//! `<progress>`, not a meter, with the kit's `Progress` look.
